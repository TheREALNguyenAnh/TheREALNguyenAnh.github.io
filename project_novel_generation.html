            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and creative writing by developing a sophisticated narrative writing assistant. The system leverages modern large language models and retrieval-augmented generation techniques to help writers maintain consistency and coherence in long-form storytelling while following structured narrative frameworks.</p>
            <p>The GitHub repository for this project is available at: <a href="https://github.com/TheREALNguyenAnh/NovelReskinProject" target="_blank">Novel Generation Repository</a>.</p>

            <h3>Core AI Architecture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a narrative writing assistant using <strong>Python</strong> as the primary programming language</li>
                <li>Integrated <strong>LangChain</strong> framework to orchestrate complex AI workflows and manage prompt engineering</li>
                <li>Utilized <strong>Google's Gemini</strong> large language model for high-quality text generation with contextual understanding</li>
                <li>Implemented structured output generation aligned with Beat Sheet story structure, ensuring consistent narrative pacing and plot development</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented a <strong>RAG system</strong> to maintain a searchable knowledge base of story elements</li>
                <li>Created persistent storage for character traits, personalities, relationships, and development arcs</li>
                <li>Maintained a comprehensive lore database to ensure world-building consistency across chapters</li>
                <li>Tracked plot details, story beats, and narrative threads to prevent continuity errors</li>
                <li>Enabled the system to retrieve relevant context dynamically when generating new content, ensuring coherence with previously established story elements</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Automated Workflow</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed an automated workflow that maintains narrative pacing throughout the novel generation process</li>
                <li>Implemented validation mechanisms to check for character consistency and plot coherence</li>
                <li>Reduced manual drafting effort by automating the generation of initial chapter drafts aligned with story structure</li>
                <li>Minimized rewriting caused by continuity errors through proactive consistency checking</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p>This project provided extensive experience with cutting-edge AI technologies and natural language processing. Working with LangChain taught me how to build complex AI workflows that maintain context and state across multiple interactions. Implementing the RAG system deepened my understanding of vector databases, semantic search, and how to effectively combine retrieval mechanisms with generative models.</p>
            <p>The challenge of maintaining narrative consistency highlighted the importance of proper knowledge representation and retrieval strategies. This project demonstrated how AI can augment creative processes while respecting the structured approaches that professional writers use, such as the Beat Sheet methodology.</p>
