            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Air Hockey game was my second venture into game development using Python and the Pygame library. It’s a digital recreation of the classic arcade air hockey game, featuring both single-player and AI-controlled gameplay.</p>

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>The game features a computer-controlled opponent that reacts dynamically based on the puck's position:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the puck is on the player’s side, the computer retreats to protect its goal.</li>
                <li>If the puck is on the computer’s side, the computer chases the puck as fast as its speed limit allows.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This simple algorithm created a challenging and enjoyable gameplay experience without overcomplicating the AI design.</p>
