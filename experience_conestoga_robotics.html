        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I joined the Conestoga Robotics Club in 2018 as part of a team that faced some challenges. Unfortunately, our team struggled due to attendance issues, and we didn't make much progress that year. However, the following year, I was appointed team captain of team 6121E.</p>

        <h2>Team Leadership</h2>
        <p>As captain, I had the opportunity to lead the team, but my inexperience as a leader meant I ended up guiding mostly freshmen. We didn't reach the heights I had hoped for, but I learned a great deal about teamwork, leadership, and perseverance during that time.</p>
        <p>One interesting thing is that my name is still featured on the club's website because the person who manages and maintains the site is from my year, and we both went to university that same year. It's like a snapshot of the club's history, frozen in time.</p>
        <p>I sometime wonder how the club is doing now and whether the team has gone on to achieve greater success. If you're curious, you can check out the club's website <a href="https://arnavkaushik.com/stogarobotics/about/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
