        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm a Computer Science student at Drexel University, currently diving deep into the world of software engineering. My journey so far has been shaped by diverse experiences, each adding a unique layer to my passion for technology and problem-solving.</p>
        <p>I was born in New Orleans but spent the first 15 years of my life in Vietnam, where my foundation in learning and culture was laid. This time was formative, offering me a perspective that still influences how I approach challenges today. I later moved to Berwyn, PA, where I attended Conestoga High School. After high school, I spent a year at Missouri University of Science and Technology before transferring to Saint Louis Community College. In 2023, I made my way to Drexel University, excited to continue my growth as a developer and to explore new opportunities in software engineering.</p>

        <h2>Current Interests</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am an active member of the Drexel Gaming Association, where I enjoy participating in various gaming events and competitions. I spend a lot of time playing Team Fight Tactics, where I am currently ranked Emerald 3. My experience in gaming has taught me valuable lessons in strategy, teamwork, and adaptabilityâ€”skills that I carry over into my software development work.</p>
