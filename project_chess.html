            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Chess project was one of my earliest experiments with Python and Pygame. It holds a special place in my heart because it was inspired by a tutorial from one of my favorite high school teachers, Edward Sharrick. He had shared Pygame tutorials on his personal YouTube channel, which I followed to create the initial version of this game. I don't know if the videos are still available, but they were invaluable to my learning process.</p>

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>After completing the tutorial, I expanded the project significantly. One of my biggest contributions was implementing a computer opponent. To achieve this, I:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard-coded the <strong>London Opening</strong>, which is one of the most well-documented openings in chess theory. This made it relatively straightforward to implement.</li>
                <li>Tested the AI opponent on <a href="https://www.chess.com" target="_blank">Chess.com</a> in classic matches. The bot achieved a rating of roughly <strong>1600</strong> after the placement games, making it a stronger player than me!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unfortunately, this project predates my consistent use of GitHub for version control. It was stored on a school laptop and has since been lost. Despite this, it remains one of my proudest projects, showcasing my early interest in game development and artificial intelligence.</p>
