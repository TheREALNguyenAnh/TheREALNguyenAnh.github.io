    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I served as a Software Developer for the Open Energy Dashboard, an open-source energy monitoring platform designed to provide real-time insights into energy consumption patterns. This role provided me with comprehensive full-stack development experience, allowing me to contribute to both frontend and backend components while working alongside a dedicated team of developers and maintainers.</p>
        <p>Under the mentorship of Project Maintainer Steven Huss-Lederman, I gained invaluable experience working across every layer of the technology stack. His guidance and teaching approach were instrumental in my professional development, and I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to learn from such an experienced mentor. His ability to create an environment where I could engage with frontend interfaces, backend logic, and database architecture significantly enhanced my understanding of full-stack development practices.</p>
