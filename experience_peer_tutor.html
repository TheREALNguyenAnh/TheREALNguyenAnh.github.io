        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>During my time at Saint Louis Community College, I served as the IT peer tutor. I was fortunate enough to be the only IT tutor across the entire three-branch campus during that time, a responsibility that came with the opportunity to work closely with faculty and students. In addition to my tutoring duties, I was also embedded as a tutor for the Access coding bootcamp, which was aimed at high school and middle school students. I worked with a team of six people to provide guidance and support for these students.</p>

        <h2>Tutoring Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>As an IT peer tutor, I was responsible for tutoring various subjects, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Intro to Programming</li>
            <li>Advanced Programming (Python and Java)</li>
            <li>Web Publishing (CSS, HTML)</li>
            <li>Computer Literacy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each subject came with its unique set of challenges, as different professors had their own preferences for programming languages. However, it was rewarding to help students with diverse needs, whether they were just beginning their programming journey or looking to deepen their skills.</p>

        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>Working as a peer tutor, I learned important skills that extend beyond technical knowledge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to be stern and not simply do the students' work for them</li>
            <li>How to guide students to the right resources and help them discover solutions on their own</li>
            <li>How to support students through patience and encouragement, while fostering independence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Being part of the Access bootcamp tutoring team was an incredible experience. I learned a lot from my colleagues and from the students themselves, and I feel that the experience helped shape my approach to teaching and mentoring others in the future.</p>
