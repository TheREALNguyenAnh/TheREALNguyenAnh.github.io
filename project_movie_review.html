            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>After completing the Language Learning Platform project, I realized I wanted to deepen my understanding of databases. This project, Movie Review Database, was my opportunity to explore and improve on that front.</p>
            <p>This was a team project in our Database Systems class and served as a fantastic opportunity to learn more about designing and working with databases. One major takeaway from the Language Learning Platform was our lack of database design experience. The schema we designed for that project was fragmented, with many lonely tables that had minimal relationships. This time, I was determined to address that issue and create a more cohesive and interconnected database structure. The project is live at: <a href="https://moviedb-winter-sound-226.fly.dev/login.html" target="_blank">Movie Review Database</a>.</p>
            <p>The GitHub repository for this project is available at: <a href="https://github.com/JeffinKR924/MovieDB" target="_blank">MovieDB Repository</a>.</p>
